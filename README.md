- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marci0liveira
- 👀 I’m interested in acquiring and developing skills on Javascript, NodeJs, data persistence approaches (i.e.: ORM for SQL and NoSQL) in order to, at some point in the future,
develop my own solution for problems within the music industry (I'm also a musician).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/NodeJs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project, meanwhile I'll be honing my skills I'll also collaborate on a project that has a meaning.
- 📫 You can reach me either at oliveira.c.marcio@gmail.com or just leave me a message here on GitHub.
