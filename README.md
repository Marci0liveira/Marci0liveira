- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marci0liveira
- 👀 I’m interested in acquire and develop knowledge on Javascript, NodeJs, data persistence approaches (i.e.: SQL and NoSQL) in order to, at some point in the future,
develop my own solution for problems within the music industry (I'm also a musician).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/NodeJs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project, meanwhile I'll be honing my skills I'll also collaborate on a project that has a meaning.
